journal = {Computer},
title = {Generic support for distributed applications},
abstract = {In the late 1980s, software designers introduced middleware platforms to support distributed computing systems. Since then, the rapid evolution of technology has caused an explosion of distributed-processing requirements. Application developers now routinely expect to support multimedia systems and mobile users and computers. Timely response to asynchronous events is crucial to such applications, but current platforms do not adequately meet this need. Another need of existing and emerging applications is the secure interoperability of independent services in large-scale, widely distributed systems. Information systems serving organizations such as universities, hospitals, and government agencies require cross-domain interaction. To meet the needs of these applications, Cambridge University researchers developed middleware extensions that provide a flexible, scalable approach to distributed-application development. This article details the extensions they developed, explaining their distributed software approach and the support it has provided for emerging applications},

title = {A brief survey of event-based middleware},
abstract = {The event-based middleware is well adapted to develop the adaptive application for the dynamic large-scale distributed computing environment and is getting more and more popular in both the academy and the industry due to its asynchronous, one-to-many and loosely-coupled push communication properties. This paper combs the concepts and architecture of event-based middleware. We briefly present five influential event-based research results, and explore the research efforts and core contents. Our research results that show the paradigm is also valuable for developing general-purpose applications are also introduced from the perspective of architecture, implementation and application.},
